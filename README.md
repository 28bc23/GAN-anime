GAN trained for nearly generating anime girls. I would appreciate feedback on how to improve this GAN, thx.
:)

**Dataset I used**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/skytnt/fbanimehq/blob/main/data/fbanimehq-00.zip


**Install - if you want it for some reason**

if you want to use it for some reason, then you just nead to extract the trained files so it's in same dir like the GAN.py file and install stuff from requirements.txt, that's it.

To train it you need to download that dataset and extract it to folder data that is located in the same dir like is the GAN.py file like in pic below or just rewrite this thrash code so it's working with your settup
and enjoy :DDDD

**What my thrash code can do after 500 epochs**

it can learn to generate shis shit in about first 85 epochs and batch size 8:
